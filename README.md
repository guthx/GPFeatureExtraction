# GPFeatureExtraction
An application based on genetic programming used to extract features from images. It's goal is to create programs that transform images using various image filters and arithmetic operations and use mean-pooling superpixelization to extract features. Using SVM classifier, GP tries to extract features in a way that maximizes classification accuracy.
